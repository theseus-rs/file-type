  <FormatName>Exclude File</FormatName>
  <FormatDescription>This entry aims to describe Exclude files that don't have a formal header or mandatory elements that can be used for automatic identification within PRONOM. The purpose of an Exclude file may be application-specific.
In Visual Studio for example, the .exclude extension is added to files that are to be ignored or not included within a project. In this instance the extension .exclude is simply appended to the file and doesn't alter the internal structure of the file in any way.</FormatDescription>
